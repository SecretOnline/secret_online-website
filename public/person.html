          <em>secret_online</em> is a name I've had since early 2010. As the
          name suggests, I prefer to keep real-life things separate from
          <a href="/internet">online</a>, so I'm not going to explain myself any
          further.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          That said, if you'll indulge me for a moment, I'm not sure it's still
          the right name for me. It has certain advantages: it has some history
          so old friends know where to find me, it reminds me to keep a healthy
          separation between online and in-person interactions, and it's unique
          enough that I don't have to surround it with "XxX_" or numbers when
          signing up for a new service.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem is that I've become more complicated as a person as time
          has gone on. This name, for all its history, reflects a part of me
          that is still very valid and worth keeping, but it's not the part of
          myself that needs exploring. There's another part of myself I need to
          figure out now.
        </p>
        <p>I don't have a name for that part.</p>
        <p>
          And that's weird to me. This name, <em>secret_online</em>, was one
          that I never had to think about. It just... happened to me. But now
          there's something else that needs attention. It's not my real life
          name, it's not <em>this</em> name, it's something else. It'll have a
          name one day, and until then I'll continue using this one for all of
          my interactions online.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't know if any of this makes sense to anyone. Maybe it doesn't
          have to. That's fine too.
