          I've done a few things over the years under this name, and since this
          is my website I'd better list them somewhere. This is listed in
          reverse chronological order, which means the most relevant stuff is at
          the top, but it makes it harder to tell the story of how I got to
          here.

          Most recently, I've been getting back involved in Minecraft. I joined
          the Treehouse server over the COVID19 pandemic, which is where I've
          been hanging around ever since. My playstyle skews more technical, so
          I've put together
          <a href="https://modrinth.com/modpack/secrets-pack" rel="external"
            >a modpack with the mods I use</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to moderate /r/Factorio subreddit while I was actively playing
          that game. It's a pretty good place, and I enjoyed being able to give
          back. I couldn't stay on the mod team forever, as real life happened
          and that's ok.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking of subreddits, I also used to moderate /r/NoMansSkyTheGame.
          This was before the game had its infamous release, and it started
          getting a bit wild towards the end. Before moderating the subreddit, I
          also put together the No Man's Sky Information Repository (<a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108013740/https://repo.nmsdb.info/"
            >archive link</a
          >,
          <a href="https://github.com/SecretOnline/Info-Repo" rel="external"
            >source</a
          >) and countdown (<a
            href="https://secretonline.github.io/NMS-Countdown/"
            >backup site</a
          >, <a href="https://github.com/SecretOnline/NMS-Countdown">source</a>)
          to the game's release. Both of these sites became important to the
          community, but also to myself. While not the biggest projects I've
          ever worked on, they probably had the widest reach. I also joined the
          unofficial IRC channel for the game, leading me to an online friend
          group that I cherish to this day.

          Before that, I ran a Minecraft server. That was a fun experience. It
          was just a small vanilla server, that never got over 10 recurring
          players. But it did give me some responsibility and social skills I
          wouldn't have learned without it. If you're one of the dozen or so
          people that played on that server, thank you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which bring us back to the beginning. While this name existed before I
          bought the game, my online presence as <em>secret_online</em> really
          started when I bought Minecraft. Minecraft, and specifically playing
          on multiplayer servers, gave me an opportunity to grow as a person. I
          made friends, something I struggled to do in real life at the time. I
          built things, giving me a creative outlet that resonated with me. I
          learned redstone, which would put me on the path to the rest of my
          life. And I had fun, which brought me back and gave me an addiction to
          video games.
