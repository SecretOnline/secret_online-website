        <p>
          Accessible Step is a mod that increases the step height of the player
          so they can walk up full blocks the same way they can do with slabs.
          This is intended as an accessibility tool, as the game's built-in auto
          jump has serious issues that cause player frustration.

            Do not download from other websites. At best you'll get an
            out-of-date version. At worst you'll download malware. I only upload
            this mod to Modrinth and Curseforge.

        <h3>What does it look like?</h3>
        <p>
          To demonstrate the difference between this mod and the game's built-in
          auto jump, I made a little comparison gif.

In the third panel the player jump up each stair in the staircase, bumping against each block and hindering progress."
