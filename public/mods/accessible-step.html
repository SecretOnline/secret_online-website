        <p>
          Accessible Step is a mod that increases the step height of the player
          so they can walk up full blocks the same way they can do with slabs.
          This is intended as an accessibility tool, as the game's built-in auto
          jump has serious issues that cause player frustration.

            Do not download from other websites. At best you'll get an
            out-of-date version. At worst you'll download malware. I only upload
            this mod to Modrinth and Curseforge.

        <p>
          There are also options to change the number of blocks the player can
          step up when walking, sneaking, or sprinting. For example, you could
          try:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Setting the walking and sprinting step heights to
            <code>1.5</code> blocks to walk over fences.
          </li>
          <li>
            Setting the sneaking and walking step heights to
            <code>0.6</code> blocks (like vanilla) but increase the sprint
            height to <code>1.25</code> blocks (to allow smoother movement while
            sprinting).
          </li>
          <li>
            Setting all three heights to <code>0</code> blocks so that you stub
            your toe on every carpet you encounter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Setting all three heights to <code>10</code> blocks, while setting
            your scale bigger using commands. You're now a giant!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What does it look like in action?</h3>
        <p>
          To demonstrate the difference between this mod and the game's built-in
          auto jump, I made a little comparison gif.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img

            alt="Three panels labeled Off, Step, and Auto-jump. In the first panel the player walks up to the staircase and stops. In the second panel the player walks up the staircase. In the third panel the player jump up each stair in the staircase, bumping against each block and hindering progress."

            alt="A sketch highlighting a red curb cut on the side of a suburban road. Highlighted in orange are people and tools that benefit from curb cuts: parents with a stroller, a suitcase with wheels, a person with a cane, a wheelchair, a hand truck, a skateboard, and two bicycles. At the bottom is the text 'When we design for disabilities we make things better for everyone.'"
