            Do not download from other websites. At best you'll get an
            out-of-date version. At worst you'll download malware. I only upload
            this mod to Modrinth and Curseforge.

        <h3>What does it add?</h3>
        <p>
          The headline feature of this mod is the ability to combine multiple
          flowers into the same block. Keeping in style of the Pink Petals,
          they're a lot smaller and flatter than the normal small flowers, so I
          called them Tiny Flowers.

            alt="A spread of the different types of Tiny Flower added by the mod. The top row contains red tulips, orange tulips, white tulips, pink tulips, torchflowers, closed eyeblossoms, open eyeblossoms, and wither roses. The bottom row contains dandelions, poppies, blue orchids, alliums, azure bluets, oxeye daisies, cornflowers, and lilies of the valley."

        <p>
          Tiny Flowers can be mixed with up to 4 flowers in the same block. With
          17 flower types (and empty spaces) in 4 slots in 4 rotations, this
          leads to nearly half a million possible combinations.

        <h3>Why make this?</h3>
        <p>
          I've been slowly expanding what kinds of mods I want to make. The next
          stage was to make a mod that adds something new. In this case, the
          something new was a series of small decorative blocks that expand on
          something already in the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Pink Petals in the game, and Wildflowers and Leaf Litter coming
          in a future update, I wanted to see what it would take to make a mod
          that allows you to put multiple types of flowers in a single block. It
          took some time to understand what I was even creating, but the ideas
          came together into the mod you see now.
