          Client Side Painting Variants is a mod that allows the player to add
          new paintings to the game without any changes to the world or server.

            Do not download from other websites. At best you'll get an
            out-of-date version. At worst you'll download malware. I only upload
            this mod to Modrinth.

        <h3>Why make this mod?</h3>
        <p>
          Resource packs change the look and feel of the game. Some packs will
          retexture paintings as part of this stylistic overhaul. I personally
          don't like this, as I have grown fond of the game's paintings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Minecraft 1.21 added new functionality to data packs that allow a
          world or server to add new paintings to the game without removing any
          of the old ones. However, this requires action by server owners and it
          affects all players on that server. Players without the right resource
          packs (even server-defined resource packs can be removed) will just
          see the black and magenta missing texture.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I set out to find a way to add new paintings, but at the individual
          client level without affecting other players.
        </p>
        <h3>What does it look like?</h3>
        <p>
          That really depends on the resource packs that are being used. It's
          like you've got new paintings in the game, I guess.
        </p>
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>
          Every entity in the game has a UUID (effectively a random number that
          stays the same as long as the entity exists) that identifies it. Based
          on this UUID, this mod will either leave the painting's texture alone
          or replace it with a different texture.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specifics of which texture to replace it with is entirely based on
          the resource packs that have been loaded. The chances for each
          painting variant have been weighted so each variant has an equal
          change of being picked when the painting is placed.
